# [Python Dashboard (MA705 final Project)](https://github.com/hattie913/ma705-Project-PythonDashboard)
This repository contains files used in the MA705 dashboard project: 
"2021 Covid-19 Cases and Vaccinations in Most Populous States in the United States".

The final dashboard is deployed on Heroku [here](https://ma705covid19-project.herokuapp.com/)

## Dashboard Description

The dashboard demonstrates how Covid-19 cases and new doses of vaccinations implemented daily in some populous US states change over time since the vaccine began to deployed nationwide in January 2021. The dashboard collects real-time data in Massachusetts and the other top 10 most populated states in the US.

Users can compare and overview the change of vcaccination implementations and daily counts of Covid-19 cases across those big states on the real-time, interactive time series graph, and get more detailed information on the table at the bottom.


# Project 2
# [Bigfoot Sightings Analysis Report](https://github.com/hattie913/Project-2-Bigfoot/blob/main/Bigfoot_sightings_analysis_report.ipynb)
This report analyzes the Bigfoot records in the United States using Python. We study the Bigfoot sightings across the counties, Bigfoot sightings between 1921 and 2018, narrative of Bigfoot sightings, the comparison between Bigfoot sightings per county and population, and the comparison between Bigfoot sightings per county and mid temperature.
